We shared all code. Unfortunately, we can not share survey raw dataã€‚

The data for this paper were collected as part of a class project paid for by the Michigan State University(MSU) Environmental Science and Policy Program (ESPP). 
As per the data use agreement, rights to access the data collectively belong to students for three years at which point data ownership reverts to ESPP. 
As a result, the data is not ours to make public and requests for the data would need to be directed to MSU ESPP 
at the completion of the three-year student embargo (in spring of 2022).
